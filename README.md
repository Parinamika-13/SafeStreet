# SafeStreet
SafeStreet includes a dedicated mobile application for maintenance teams, streamlining road damage detection and reporting. On-field personnel can capture images and upload them directly to the system via the app, which syncs with the backend for analysis. The ViT model processes the uploaded image to classify damage, assess severity, and generate a detailed text summary. This summary highlights the type of damage, severity, and repair priority, which is shared with the relevant admin or authority through an automated email. The MERN-based web platform complements the app by offering advanced visualizations, insights, and historical analysis for roadÂ authorities.
